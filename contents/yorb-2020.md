# YORB 2020

## TL;DR
This is a multi-user online version of the NYU ITP/IMA floor. It is accessible via your web browser (mobile-supported) and mixed reality headsets. This prototype was deployed with [Hubs by Mozilla](https://hubs.mozilla.com/#/). You interact with others and add content to the virtual space. See you there, and please send us your [feedback](https://discordapp.com/channels/686702701769392133/692460981464334427) so we can renovate with improvements!

#### Handy Tips 
* Wear headphones! 
* Easiest way to move around: :arrow_left::arrow_up::arrow_down::arrow_right: + 🆀🅴 keys
* Use Firefox over Chrome (and definitely not Safari)
* If YORB is slow, lower the material quality: Upper left menu > Preferences > Material Quality > Low

## What is this? 🏡
Welcome back to the floor! We missed you. We created this shared online space to hang out, share, collaborate, and work near each other in our open browser tabs. 

This floor is built out of a [Mozilla Hubs Room](https://hubs.mozilla.com/#/). The IRL Floor has many rooms, so this might get confusing. We'll just call it [YORB](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/contents/yorb-2020.md#what-is-yorb-) from now on.

This guide will show you some things to try there. This is a community experiment, and Mozilla Hubs is in active development. We welcome [contributions](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/contents/yorb-2020.md#itpima-discord-yorb-2020-channel) as we navigate the possibilities.


## What can I do? 🗣
Many things. Here's an incomplete list.

### Select an Avatar

### Move Around 
* Use your mouse or WASDQE keys
* All other device controls [here](https://github.com/mozilla/hubs/wiki/Hubs-Controls)

### Chat via Text, Voice, and Video*

### Add Content* 
* Draw in 3D
* Drag and drop to import photos, GIFs, PDFs, videos, and 3D models in GLTF 
format from sites like [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) or [Poly](https://poly.google.com/)
* Copy and paste URLs to import images, videos (YouTube only), and 3D models
* Add YouTube Live events
    * If you want to stream your own event, you'll need to set up a [live streaming encoder](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2907883?hl=en). A free and easy-to use option is [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), and the residents can teach you (Jesse, Ellen, and Chelsea).
    * Google shut down their YouTube service to broadcast group video calls but [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/) is a free alternative for streaming into a YouTube Live event with multiple participants.
    * You can also route a Zoom call into OBS and then into a YouTube Live Stream. So many streams. 
    * Make your own stuff! **Coming Soon!**

\* Please note that all text chats and a record of added objects will broadcast to the YORB Discord channel.

## What is the code of conduct? 🌈
YORB is intended for all members of the ITP/IMA community (students, faculty, staff, residents, and fellows) to play, explore possibilities of interacting in this online environment, help each other, learn from one another, stumble upon YORB lore, and start their own.

This Code of Conduct is based on [The Coding Train's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Code-of-Conduct), which is in turn based on the [p5.js Code of Conduct](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

Following [NYU's Conduct Policies](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/student-community-standards/university-student-conduct-policies.html), we are committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space for everyone in the community. Harassment or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated, and this applies to any interactions and content in YORB Hubs rooms, and any other YORB spaces
including but not limited to the ITP/IMA Discord and GitHub.

**Be mindful of your language**. Any of the following behavior is unacceptable:
* Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
* Threats of violence
* Deliberate intimidation
* Sexually explicit or violent material
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Stalking or following
* Or any other kinds of harassment

Use your best judgment. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.

**Be respectful**. Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care.

**Be considerate**. Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community.

**Be open minded**. Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

To report an interaction or content that violates this code, please use [Discord](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/contents/yorb-2020.md#itpima-discord-yorb-2020-channel). Participants will be asked to stop any harassing behavior immediately and offensive content will be removed.

Thank you for helping to make YORB an inviting, vibrant, and safe space for our community.

This statement will be updated in response to community needs, and all feedback and contributions are welcome in the [YORB Discord channel](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/contents/yorb-2020.md#itpima-discord-yorb-2020-channel).

## How do I get there? 🔑
1. Navigate to [Discord](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/contents/yorb-2020.md#itpima-discord-yorb-2020-channel)
1. Click into YORB (created with Hubs by Mozilla bot)
1. Click Sign into Discord
1. Click Authorize


## YORB is full, now what? 😱
In order to support mobile users, the recommended capacity of a Hubs Room is 25 users. If YORB is full, you can still hear what's going on from the lobby and use the chat to interact with others. 

Possible workarounds include linking to other YORBs from within YORB (the ITP/IMA multiverse!), as well as developing our own server infrastructure to experiment with this and other features. 


## How can I customize my avatar? 🤖
Not a 3D developer? No worries, it's simple to create a skin for a Hubs robot avatar, and you save custom avatars in your account. Here are the quickest options:

### Use an Image
1. Drag and drop an image file or URL into [Quilt](https://tryquilt.io/)
1. Click Export
1. [Discord](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/contents/yorb-2020.md#itpima-discord-yorb-2020-channel) > Enter YORB > Set Name & Avatar > Browse Avatars > Create Avatar > Click to upload Base Map > Select your exported file > Save

![demo](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/images/avatar-quilt-demo.gif)

### Photoshop an Avatar Skin
1. Download this and open this [template](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-avatar-pipelines/blob/master/Photoshop/AvatarBot_2D_Layout_Layers.psd) 
1. Use different images, paint directly on the layers, or create a new layer following the guides
1. Uncheck the layer AvatarBot_UVs from the Layers' panel and export an image file
1. [Discord](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/contents/yorb-2020.md#itpima-discord-yorb-2020-channel) > Enter Yorb > Set Name & Avatar > Browse Avatars > Create Avatar > Click to upload Base Map > Select your exported file > Save

For example, say you want to create an avatar skin with the face of Tom circa 1996 and in a tuxedo. Create a face texture by blending together different portrait views and paint on the formal wear (or apply a readymade black tie layer from Mozilla [here](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-avatar-pipelines/tree/master/Exported%20Texture%20Sets).)

![demo](https://github.com/itpresidents/YORB/blob/master/images/avatar-robot-tom.jpg)

There are plenty more options! If you're versed in creating 3D assets, then we'd love to post your steps here for additional customization possibilities. Check out these [recommendations](https://github.com/MozillaReality/hubs-avatar-pipelines) from Mozilla. [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is free, open source 3D creation software for building custom models, and the latest version (2.8) exports the GLTF / GLB file that is compatible with Mozilla Hubs.

## What is YORB? 🌏
We're still figuring it out. More resources to come, but here are some clues from the 1990s:

> The Yorb was a television show broadcast by the New York University’s (NYU) Open Telecommunications Program (ITP). It transmitted computer graphics of a cartoon-like 3D world, which could be interacted with and ‘navigated’ by viewers using their home telephone numerical keypads. [Source](https://fog.ccsf.edu/~dcox/EMU/ravingwithyorb.htm)

> Yorb -- An Electronic Neighborhood -- The place to spread your message[,] See your art, announcements, ads, scribbles, music, home movies, distribute billboards, documents, and ...?... on Manhattan Cable Channel 34 Thursday nights at 11pm ..be there!
